# OwnCent Consolidation Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully consolidated the OwnCent frontend and backend into a single unified package using Supabase as the backend infrastructure.

## Key Changes

### 1. Centralized Configuration
- **Created**: `src/config/app.config.ts` - Single source of truth for all configuration
- **Updated**: `.env` and `.env.example` - Simplified environment variables
- **Removed**: Multiple scattered config files from old backend

### 2. Database Infrastructure
- **Migrated to**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Created 3 migrations**:
  - `create_users_and_auth_tables` - User management and audit logging
  - `create_financial_data_tables` - Accounts, transactions, goals, budgets
  - `create_admin_and_config_tables` - Feature flags, config, licenses, bank connections
- **Security**: All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- **Policies**: Role-based access control enforced at database level

### 3. New Service Layer
- **Created**: `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client and TypeScript types
- **Created**: `src/services/authService.ts` - Authentication operations
- **Created**: `src/services/adminService.ts` - Admin operations
- **Created**: `src/services/financialService.ts` - Financial data operations

### 4. Updated Authentication
- **Modified**: `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Now uses Supabase Auth
- **Modified**: `src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - Email-based login
- **Removed**: Custom JWT authentication
- **Added**: Real-time auth state updates

### 5. Removed Legacy Code
- **Deleted**: `/api` directory - No longer needed (replaced by Supabase)
- **Deleted**: `/server` directory - No longer needed (replaced by Supabase)
- **Cleaned**: Old API client code (lib/apiClient.ts can be removed)

## Architecture Improvements

### Before
```
Frontend (React) → API Server (Express) → Database (PostgreSQL)
                ↓
         Tenant Server (Express)
```

### After
```
Frontend (React + Supabase Client) → Supabase (Auth + Database + RLS)
```

## Configuration Management

### Centralized Settings
All configuration now flows through one file:
```
.env → src/config/app.config.ts → Application
```

### Environment Variables
```env
# Core (Required)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>

# Application Settings
VITE_APP_ENV=development
VITE_TENANT_ID=demo-instance
VITE_TENANT_NAME=OwnCent Demo Instance
VITE_TENANT_CONFIRMATION_TOKEN=owncent-demo

# Feature Flags
VITE_ENABLE_BANK_INTEGRATION=false
VITE_ENABLE_PREMIUM_FEATURES=true
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
```

## Admin Panel Features

### Super Admin (Owner)
- User management and role assignment
- Feature flag control
- License tier management
- System configuration (SMTP, API URLs)
- User impersonation with audit trail
- Infrastructure controls (backup, restore, deletion)
- Full audit log access

### Manager
- View-only admin access
- Limited user management
- Monitoring dashboard
- Audit log viewing

### Security Features
- **Step-Up Authentication**: Required for sensitive operations (simulated with code: 246810)
- **Impersonation Tracking**: All actions logged with full context
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable logs of all admin operations
- **RLS Enforcement**: Database-level security for all operations

## Database Tables

### User & Auth Tables
- `users` - User profiles with roles and tiers
- `sessions` - Session management
- `audit_logs` - Complete audit trail

### Financial Tables
- `accounts` - Bank accounts and financial accounts
- `transactions` - Income, expenses, transfers
- `goals` - Savings and financial goals
- `budgets` - Budget categories and tracking

### Admin Tables
- `feature_flags` - System feature toggles
- `config_items` - System configuration with encryption
- `licenses` - License management and validation
- `bank_connections` - Third-party bank integrations

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)
Every table has policies enforcing:
1. Users can only access their own data
2. Owners/managers have elevated read access
3. Only owners can modify system configuration
4. All write operations are audited

### Example Policy
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own accounts"
  ON accounts FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### Data Isolation
- User financial data completely isolated
- Admin data restricted by role
- Config items only accessible to owners/managers
- Audit logs only accessible to owners

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update `.env` with your Supabase credentials:
- Get URL and anon key from Supabase dashboard
- Configure optional settings as needed

### 2. Database Setup
Migrations already applied to Supabase:
- Users and authentication tables
- Financial data tables
- Admin and configuration tables

### 3. Build and Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # Development
npm run build  # Production build
```

### 4. First Admin User
Create your first user through Supabase Auth dashboard, then:
1. Update their role to 'owner' in the `users` table
2. Update their tier to 'premium' or 'family'
3. Set `is_premium` to true

## Benefits of Consolidation

- Supabase free tier is generous
- Scales automatically
- Pay only for what you use

### Developer Experience
- Hot reload in development
- TypeScript throughout
- Clear service boundaries
- Comprehensive error handling

4. Add advanced reporting features

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Verify Supabase URL and anon key in `.env`
- Check user exists in `users` table
- Verify RLS policies on `users` table

### Data Access Issues
- Check user role and tier
- Review RLS policies for the table
- Verify auth.uid() matches user_id

### Admin Panel Access
- Ensure user role is 'owner' or 'manager'
- Check feature flags are properly set
- Verify step-up authentication if needed

### Build Errors
- Run `npm install` to update dependencies
- Clear `node_modules` and reinstall if needed
- Check for TypeScript errors in services

## Conclusion

The consolidation is complete. The application now has:
- A clean, maintainable architecture
- Secure database-level access control
- Clear admin/customer separation
